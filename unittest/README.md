# Tests for the unit tests

This directory contains a simple script that runs unit tests over a
collection of examples and compares the output w.r.t. saved regression
data. Any difference is reported as a potential error.

**Note**: Keep this simple and do not rely on unit test library to
check the unit test library itself.

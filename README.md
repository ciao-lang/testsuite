# A general test suite for Ciao

This is a general test suite for the Ciao language, its
implementation, and the integration of several of its tools and
components (that is, integration tests and benchmarks).

Tests here should allow measuring:

 - correctness of compiler, optimizer, analyzer, etc. (including
   parser, pretty print, output, ...)

 - performance (time, memory consumption) of the engine, runtime,
   libraries, compiler and analysis

 - conformance with standards

 - comparison with other languages and Prolog implementations

**NOTE**: Do not include unit tests for particular libraries here.
